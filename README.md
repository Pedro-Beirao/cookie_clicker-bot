# cookie_clicker-bot
The fastest cookie clicker bot in the west.

Program written in python3

At first I tried using pyautogui, but is was too slow, so I ended up using pynput.

When you start the script, you will have 5 seconds to put your mouse on the cookie. It will then click as fast as it can.

Press ESC to exit.

## Install

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/PBeGood4/cookie_clicker-bot/
```

## Run

```
$ cookiebot.py
```

Have fun beating WRs

This bot can reach over 900 clicks per second (Depends on the speed of your PC)
