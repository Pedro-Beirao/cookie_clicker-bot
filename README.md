# cookie_clicker-bot
The fastest cookie clicker bot in the west.

___

**Tested with python 3.9**

___

At first I tried using pyautogui, but is was too slow, so I ended up using pynput.

When you start the script, you will have 5 seconds to put your mouse on the cookie. It will then click as fast as it can.

Press ESC to exit.
